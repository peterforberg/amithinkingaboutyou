              Mixed-up Moon by Anthony Madrid&nbsp;<br><br>
              Mixed-up moon. Prop open the book.<br>
Now and forever, you nip it in the bud.<br>
I allow the heart does not make the blood,<br>
Nor the human being the book.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Mixed-up moon. I don’t have to look.<br>
<em>Que no quiero ver</em> that talked-up perfection.<br>
It’s no use trying to rub out your reflection<br>
From a piece of polished brass.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Mixed-up moon. I’ll take that as a yes.<br>
I’ll take it outside, out of ’shot of the mourners.<br>
I think you’ll agree it’s time we cut corners. We’ll cut<br>
So many corners, the thing becomes a sphere.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Mixed-up moon. Insincere, insincere.<br>
Thomas à Kempis and Francis Xavier.<br>
The Better Book says that good behavior<br>
Is the privilege, not the duty, of the good.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Mixed-up moon. Don’t misunderstood.<br>
You close the circuit, find out what it’s worth.<br>
Redwood roots running deep in the earth:<br>
They only go down six feet.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Mixed-up moon. Pilgrimage sweet.<br>
All with me’s meete that I fashion fit.<br>
We wake and forget the dream we were having:<br>
Same thing happens to childhood.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Mixed-up moon. Already reviled it.<br>
Bird in the egg and a tale to embroider.<br>
Any ten words in any order,<br>
The result will be the same.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Mixed-up moon. <em>Verstehn Sie ihn?</em><br>
<em>Ich—hüte mich, ihn zu verstehn.</em><br>
About these kids making out on the train,<br>
I say: <em>Deja ir a mi pueblo.</em><br>
&nbsp;<br>
Mixed-up moon. Count Dracula Twemlow.<br>
Twelve disciples and a canine nuisance.<br>
<em>My</em> rabbi says that whoever chooses<br>
Belief is not a believer.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Mixed-up moon. Rock-’em Occam’s cleaver.<br>
First publication in form of a fascicle.<br>
Children! they don’t even know it’s possible:<br>
Having friends you don’t like.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Mixed-up moon. Riker’s Island bike.<br>
Raking the grass and raking the weed.<br>
A plane’s shadow on building and street:<br>
It doesn’t travel the speed of the plane.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Mixed-up moon. <em>Semper</em> the same.<br>
Temperament, temperament, given to worry.<br>
Their fault is they can’t even tell a story<br>
Unless they understand it.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Mixed-up moon. Give Petunia a minute.<br>
He’s gone over to Jesus, molted a feather.<br>
Any ten shapes, taken together,<br>
Are a jigsaw of the degenerate body.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Mixed-up moon. Gastrocnemius.<br>
Hard for these geniuses, easy for children.<br>
Most of what passes for bravery is only<br>
Want of imagination.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Mixed-up moon. Insert pagination.<br>
Bird in the egg, picking its fur.<br>
You want to know what’s in it for her?<br>
Your good looks and diction/syntax.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Mixed-up moon. Everybody wins.<br>
<em>¡Aléjate de mí, Satanás!</em> unless<br>
Any lit match will pass for a compass:<br>
The flame points up, because hell is above us.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Mixed-up moon. Hell is above. 29 April 2014:<br>
I have memorized the Hindu poem that says<br>
This hunk of quartz must someday flex<br>
Its back and run up a tree.<br>

Lullaby by WH Auden

Lay your sleeping head, my love,
Human on my faithless arm;
Time and fevers burn away
Individual beauty from
Thoughtful children, and the grave
Proves the child ephemeral:
But in my arms till break of day
Let the living creature lie,
Mortal, guilty, but to me
The entirely beautiful.

Soul and body have no bounds:
To lovers as they lie upon
Her tolerant enchanted slope
In their ordinary swoon,
Grave the vision Venus sends
Of supernatural sympathy,
Universal love and hope;
While an abstract insight wakes
Among the glaciers and the rocks
The hermit's carnal ecstasy.

Certainty, fidelity
On the stroke of midnight pass
Like vibrations of a bell,
And fashionable madmen raise
Their pedantic boring cry:
Every farthing of the cost,
All the dreaded cards foretell,
Shall be paid, but from this night
Not a whisper, not a thought,
Not a kiss nor look be lost.

Beauty, midnight, vision dies:
Let the winds of dawn that blow
Softly round your dreaming head
Such a day of welcome show
Eye and knocking heart may bless,
Find the mortal world enough;
Noons of dryness find you fed
By the involuntary powers,
Nights of insult let you pass
Watched by every human love.</pre>

Thanks by WS Merwin

Listen
with the night falling we are saying thank you
we are stopping on the bridges to bow from the railings
we are running out of the glass rooms
with our mouths full of food to look at the sky
and say thank you
we are standing by the water thanking it
standing by the windows looking out
in our directions

back from a series of hospitals back from a mugging
after funerals we are saying thank you
after the news of the dead
whether or not we knew them we are saying thank you

over telephones we are saying thank you
in doorways and in the backs of cars and in elevators
remembering wars and the police at the door
and the beatings on stairs we are saying thank you
in the banks we are saying thank you
in the faces of the officials and the rich
and of all who will never change
we go on saying thank you thank you

with the animals dying around us
taking our feelings we are saying thank you
with the forests falling faster than the minutes
of our lives we are saying thank you
with the words going out like cells of a brain
with the cities growing over us
we are saying thank you faster and faster
with nobody listening we are saying thank you
thank you we are saying and waving
dark though it is

    <h4>Here's a poem</h4>
<pre>
From "A Season in Hell" by Arthur Rimbaud

It is recovered!
What? Eternity.
It is the sea
Mixed with the sun.

My soul eternal,
Redeem your promise,
In spite of the night alone
And the day on fire.

Of human suffrage,
Of common aspirings,
You free yourself then!
You fly according to...

Hope never more,
No orietur.
Science and patience,
Retribution is sure.

No more tomorrows,
Embers of satin,
Your ardor is now
Your duty only.

It is recovered!
What? Eternity.
It is the sea
Mixed with the sun.
</pre>
<h4>Or, in French:</h4>
<pre>
Elle est retrouvée.
Quoi? - L'Éternité.
C'est la mer allée
Avec le soleil.

Âme sentinelle,
Murmurons l'aveu
De la nuit si nulle
Et du jour en feu.

Des humains suffrages,
Des communs élans
Là tu te dégages
Et voles selon.

Puisque de vous seules,
Braises de satin,
Le Devoir s'exhale
Sans qu'on dise : enfin.

Là pas d'espérance,
Nul orietur.
Science avec patience,
Le supplice est sûr.

Elle est retrouvée.
Quoi ? - L'Éternité.
C'est la mer allée
Avec le soleil.

<h4>Here's a poem?</h4>
<p>I went home to see my parents today. We set up a projector in the backyard and listened to music. This is an OK Nick Cave song, not compositionally the most interesting, but I quoted it in my Master's thesis. Anyways, a link and the lyrics.</p>

I am beside you
I am beside you
I am beside you
I am beside you
Look for me
Look for me
I am beside you
Look for me
I try to forget
To remember
That nothing is something
Where something is meant to be
I am beside you
I am beside you
Look for me
Look for me
Well, I think they’ve gathered here for me
I am within you
You are within me
I am beside you
You are beside me
I think they’re singing to be free
I think they’re singing to be free
I think my friends have gathered here for me
I think they’ve gathered here
To be beside me
Look for me
Look for me
I am beside you
You are beside me
You are beside me
Look for me

<h4>Here's some pictures</h4>
<p>I promise these are the last baby photos, which you've probably already seen, but they are Spiderman in nature.</p>
