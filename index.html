              Mixed-up Moon by Anthony Madrid&nbsp;<br><br>
              Mixed-up moon. Prop open the book.<br>
Now and forever, you nip it in the bud.<br>
I allow the heart does not make the blood,<br>
Nor the human being the book.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Mixed-up moon. I don’t have to look.<br>
<em>Que no quiero ver</em> that talked-up perfection.<br>
It’s no use trying to rub out your reflection<br>
From a piece of polished brass.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Mixed-up moon. I’ll take that as a yes.<br>
I’ll take it outside, out of ’shot of the mourners.<br>
I think you’ll agree it’s time we cut corners. We’ll cut<br>
So many corners, the thing becomes a sphere.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Mixed-up moon. Insincere, insincere.<br>
Thomas à Kempis and Francis Xavier.<br>
The Better Book says that good behavior<br>
Is the privilege, not the duty, of the good.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Mixed-up moon. Don’t misunderstood.<br>
You close the circuit, find out what it’s worth.<br>
Redwood roots running deep in the earth:<br>
They only go down six feet.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Mixed-up moon. Pilgrimage sweet.<br>
All with me’s meete that I fashion fit.<br>
We wake and forget the dream we were having:<br>
Same thing happens to childhood.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Mixed-up moon. Already reviled it.<br>
Bird in the egg and a tale to embroider.<br>
Any ten words in any order,<br>
The result will be the same.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Mixed-up moon. <em>Verstehn Sie ihn?</em><br>
<em>Ich—hüte mich, ihn zu verstehn.</em><br>
About these kids making out on the train,<br>
I say: <em>Deja ir a mi pueblo.</em><br>
&nbsp;<br>
Mixed-up moon. Count Dracula Twemlow.<br>
Twelve disciples and a canine nuisance.<br>
<em>My</em> rabbi says that whoever chooses<br>
Belief is not a believer.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Mixed-up moon. Rock-’em Occam’s cleaver.<br>
First publication in form of a fascicle.<br>
Children! they don’t even know it’s possible:<br>
Having friends you don’t like.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Mixed-up moon. Riker’s Island bike.<br>
Raking the grass and raking the weed.<br>
A plane’s shadow on building and street:<br>
It doesn’t travel the speed of the plane.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Mixed-up moon. <em>Semper</em> the same.<br>
Temperament, temperament, given to worry.<br>
Their fault is they can’t even tell a story<br>
Unless they understand it.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Mixed-up moon. Give Petunia a minute.<br>
He’s gone over to Jesus, molted a feather.<br>
Any ten shapes, taken together,<br>
Are a jigsaw of the degenerate body.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Mixed-up moon. Gastrocnemius.<br>
Hard for these geniuses, easy for children.<br>
Most of what passes for bravery is only<br>
Want of imagination.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Mixed-up moon. Insert pagination.<br>
Bird in the egg, picking its fur.<br>
You want to know what’s in it for her?<br>
Your good looks and diction/syntax.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Mixed-up moon. Everybody wins.<br>
<em>¡Aléjate de mí, Satanás!</em> unless<br>
Any lit match will pass for a compass:<br>
The flame points up, because hell is above us.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Mixed-up moon. Hell is above. 29 April 2014:<br>
I have memorized the Hindu poem that says<br>
This hunk of quartz must someday flex<br>
Its back and run up a tree.<br>
