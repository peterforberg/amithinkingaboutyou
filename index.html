<h4>Here's a poem?</h4>
<p>I went home to see my parents today. We set up a projector in the backyard and listened to music. This is an OK Nick Cave song, not compositionally the most interesting, but I quoted it in my Master's thesis. Anyways, a link and the lyrics.</p>

I am beside you
I am beside you
I am beside you
I am beside you
Look for me
Look for me
I am beside you
Look for me
I try to forget
To remember
That nothing is something
Where something is meant to be
I am beside you
I am beside you
Look for me
Look for me
Well, I think they’ve gathered here for me
I am within you
You are within me
I am beside you
You are beside me
I think they’re singing to be free
I think they’re singing to be free
I think my friends have gathered here for me
I think they’ve gathered here
To be beside me
Look for me
Look for me
I am beside you
You are beside me
You are beside me
Look for me

<h4>Here's some pictures</h4>
<p>I promise these are the last baby photos, which you've probably already seen, but they are Spiderman in nature.</p>
